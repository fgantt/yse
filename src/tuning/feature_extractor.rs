//! Feature extraction system for automated tuning
//!
//! This module provides functionality to extract feature vectors from game
//! positions for use in the automated tuning process. The feature extraction
//! system breaks down the evaluation function into individual components that
//! can be tuned independently.
//!
//! Key features extracted:
//! - Material balance (piece counts and values)
//! - Positional features (piece-square tables)
//! - King safety (castles, attacks, threats)
//! - Pawn structure (chains, advancement, isolation)
//! - Mobility (move counts and piece activity) - **Uses actual move
//!   generation**
//! - Piece coordination (connected pieces, attacks) - **Uses actual move
//!   generation**
//! - Center control (occupation patterns)
//! - Development (piece positioning and activity)
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//!
//! ### Mobility Features
//! Mobility features are calculated using actual legal move generation rather
//! than heuristic estimates. The `extract_mobility_features()` method:
//! - Generates all legal moves for the player using
//!   `MoveGenerator::generate_legal_moves()`
//! - Counts moves per piece type (Pawn, Lance, Knight, Silver, Gold, Bishop,
//!   Rook)
//! - Calculates total mobility as the total number of legal moves
//! - Measures center mobility by counting moves targeting center squares
//!
//! This provides accurate mobility measurements that reflect the actual
//! tactical capabilities of the position, rather than simplified estimates.
//!
//! ### Coordination Features
//! Coordination features analyze actual piece interactions using move
//! generation:
//! - **Connected Rooks**: Detects rooks on same rank/file with clear paths
//! - **Piece Coordination**: Counts moves that support friendly pieces or
//!   coordinate attacks
//! - **Attack Coordination**: Identifies squares attacked by multiple pieces
//! - **Defense Coordination**: Measures how well pieces defend each other
//!
//! These features use actual move generation to identify real tactical
//! relationships between pieces, providing more accurate coordination
//! measurements than distance-based heuristics.
