//! Feature extractors: modules that derive features/signals from board state.
//!
//! This namespace groups evaluation components whose primary responsibility is
//! computing features (not final scoring). Public re-exports are provided to
//! avoid breaking existing imports while establishing a clearer structure.
//!
//! Responsibilities:
//! - Position/positional/tactical/endgame/opening feature extraction
//! - Piece-square tables and related loaders
//! - Castle recognition and pattern libraries
//!
//! Aggregation/scoring lives under `crate::evaluation::aggregators`.
