//! Unified Configuration System for Tapered Evaluation
//!
//! This module provides a comprehensive configuration system that unifies all
//! tapered evaluation components. It supports:
//! - Unified configuration struct
//! - Configuration loading from files (JSON/TOML)
//! - Configuration validation
//! - Runtime configuration updates
//! - Configuration presets
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use crate::evaluation::config::TaperedEvalConfig;
//!
//! // Create default configuration
//! let config = TaperedEvalConfig::default();
//!
//! // Create performance-optimized configuration
//! let config = TaperedEvalConfig::performance_optimized();
//!
//! // Load from file
//! let config = TaperedEvalConfig::load_from_file("eval_config.json")?;
//!
//! // Validate configuration
//! assert!(config.validate().is_ok());
//! ```

///
/// # Weight Calibration Methodology
///
/// Evaluation weights control the relative importance of different evaluation components.
/// The final evaluation score is calculated as:
/// ```
/// total_score = material_score * material_weight
///            + position_score * position_weight
///            + king_safety_score * king_safety_weight
///            + ... (for all enabled components)
/// ```
///
/// ## Recommended Weight Ranges
///
/// - **Material weight**: 0.8-1.2 (typically 1.0). Material is fundamental and should be stable.
/// - **Position weight (PST)**: 0.5-1.5 (typically 1.0). Piece-square tables provide positional bonuses.
/// - **King safety weight**: 0.8-1.5 (typically 1.0). Critical for king safety evaluation.
/// - **Pawn structure weight**: 0.6-1.2 (typically 0.8). Important but less critical than material.
/// - **Mobility weight**: 0.4-0.8 (typically 0.6). Piece mobility is important but secondary.
/// - **Center control weight**: 0.5-1.0 (typically 0.7). Center control is valuable but not decisive.
/// - **Development weight**: 0.3-0.7 (typically 0.5). Development matters most in opening.
/// - **Tactical weight**: 0.8-1.5 (typically 1.0). Tactical patterns are important in middlegame.
/// - **Positional weight**: 0.8-1.5 (typically 1.0). Positional patterns matter throughout the game.
/// - **Castle weight**: 0.7-1.3 (typically 1.0). Castle patterns are important for king safety.
///
/// ## Weight Calibration Examples
///
/// ### Aggressive Play Style
/// ```rust
/// let mut weights = EvaluationWeights::default();
/// weights.tactical_weight = 1.5;  // Emphasize tactical patterns
/// weights.mobility_weight = 0.8;   // Value piece activity
/// weights.development_weight = 0.7; // Emphasize quick development
/// ```
///
/// ### Positional Play Style
/// ```rust
/// let mut weights = EvaluationWeights::default();
/// weights.positional_weight = 1.5;      // Emphasize positional patterns
/// weights.pawn_structure_weight = 1.2;   // Value pawn structure
/// weights.center_control_weight = 1.0;    // Emphasize center control
/// ```
///
/// ### Defensive Play Style
/// ```rust
/// let mut weights = EvaluationWeights::default();
/// weights.king_safety_weight = 1.5;      // Emphasize king safety
/// weights.castle_weight = 1.3;            // Value castle formations
/// weights.tactical_weight = 0.8;          // Reduce tactical emphasis
/// ```
///
/// ## Weight Interaction Effects
///
/// Changing one weight affects the overall evaluation balance:
///
/// - **Increasing material_weight**: Makes material advantages more decisive. May reduce
///   the impact of positional factors. Typical range: 0.8-1.2.
///
/// - **Increasing tactical_weight**: Makes tactical patterns (forks, pins, skewers) more
///   influential. Good for aggressive play. Typical range: 0.8-1.5.
///
/// - **Increasing positional_weight**: Makes positional patterns (outposts, weak squares,
///   piece activity) more influential. Good for positional play. Typical range: 0.8-1.5.
///
/// - **Increasing king_safety_weight**: Makes king safety more important. May reduce
///   emphasis on material or positional factors. Typical range: 0.8-1.5.
///
/// - **Increasing pawn_structure_weight**: Makes pawn structure more important. Good for
///   endgame play. Typical range: 0.6-1.2.
///
/// - **Increasing mobility_weight**: Makes piece mobility more important. Good for open
///   positions. Typical range: 0.4-0.8.
///
/// - **Increasing center_control_weight**: Makes center control more important. Good for
///   opening and middlegame. Typical range: 0.5-1.0.
///
/// - **Increasing development_weight**: Makes piece development more important. Primarily
///   affects opening evaluation. Typical range: 0.3-0.7.
///
/// - **Increasing castle_weight**: Makes castle patterns more important. Good for king
///   safety evaluation. Typical range: 0.7-1.3.
///
/// ## Calibration Tips
///
/// 1. **Start with defaults**: The default weights are balanced and work well for most positions.
/// 2. **Adjust incrementally**: Change weights by 0.1-0.2 at a time and test the impact.
/// 3. **Consider game phase**: Use phase-dependent weight scaling (see `enable_phase_dependent_weights`)
///    to adjust weights based on game phase.
/// 4. **Monitor cumulative weights**: Use `validate_cumulative_weights()` to ensure total weight
///    sum is reasonable (typically 5.0-15.0).
/// 5. **Test with positions**: Evaluate test positions to verify weight changes produce expected
///    behavior.
/// 6. **Use telemetry**: Monitor `weight_contributions` in `EvaluationTelemetry` to see which
///    components contribute most to evaluation.
///
/// ## Validation
///
/// Weights are validated to ensure they are:
/// - Non-negative (weights < 0.0 are invalid)
/// - Within reasonable range (typically 0.0-10.0, though 0.5-2.0 is more common)
/// - Finite (NaN and infinity are invalid)
///
/// Use `TaperedEvalConfig::validate()` to check weight validity.
